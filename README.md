Precedence:

	Not being able to handle double parathensis to well.

Test:
	
	Mulitple tests can get mess and doesn't always work.
	
There is a limit to how many commands you can do but don't think it should be a problem.

=======
Connectors:

	I could not get the connectors work besides ';'.

	I don't have errors coming when a connector is first.

	';' doesn't work when echo command is the first command.

Exit:

	Exit only works with first command.
