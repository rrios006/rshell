# rshell

This assignment builds on the past one. Rshell should now be able to handle redirection with the use of the connecters: <, >, >>, and, |.

#Run program
1 open terminal and enter  $ git clone https://github.com/rrios006/rshell.git

2 enter $ cd rshell

3 enter $ git checkout hw4

4 make exe by entering  $ make 

5 execute $ bin/rshell

#Bugs

-Output redirection has trouble with commands that aren't single commands.

-Redirection has some problems with normall connectors

-Precedence introduces some issues with redirection sometimes

-Error to wrong input can mess with spacing sometimes
