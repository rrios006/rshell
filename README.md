# rshell

This assignment builds on the past one. Rshell should now be able to use test function and handle parathensis. I will also know precedence.

#Run program
1 open terminal and enter  $ git clone https://github.com/rrios006/rshell.git

2 enter $ cd rshell

3 enter $ git checkout hw3

4 make exe by entering  $ make 

5 execute $ bin/rshell

#Bugs
Precedence:

	Not being able to handle double parathensis to well.

Test:
	
	Mulitple tests can get mess and doesn't always work.
	
There is a limit to how many commands you can do but don't think it should be a problem.
