# rshell

This assignment is about remaking a basic version of shell that is able to handle connectors such as &&, ||, and ;. We must also make our own version of an exit function.

#Run program
1 open terminal and enter  $ git clone https://github.com/rrios006/rshell.git

2 enter $ cd rshell

3 enter $ git checkout hw2

4 make exe by entering  $ make 

5 execute $ bin/rshell

#Bugs
Connectors:
	I could not get the connectors work besides ';'
	I don't have errors coming when a connector is first
Error messages could use some work
